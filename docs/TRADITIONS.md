# Closing thoughts
This is based on data collected by starting every commandment then taking the first tradition and checking which tenets were new compared to the initial commandment.
         When that was not enough, other specific paths were taken to get the same tradition as second choice such that no already-granted tenets overlapped.
I've also made a program in Python that can help navigate this structure, just run main.py.
