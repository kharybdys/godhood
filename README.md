# Introduction 
This repository is made to help me figure out the relations between traditions and tenets in the game [Godhood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/917150/Godhood/).
The main focus point is the file godhood.json (found in data), which contains my observations during the game in structured form.
The code here is written to help navigate that, and to generate the three guides that can be found in the docs folder: 
* [Events](./docs/EVENTS.md)
* [Classes](./docs/CLASSES.md)
* [Traditions](./docs/TRADITIONS.md)


# Program
If you want to run the program, get Python 3.11 and run main.py. You will then see the following interactive prompt:
```
What do you want to do?
[1] Find the next reachable traditions given a tradition path?
[2] List all paths to reach a given tradition?
[3] Print the tradition tree?
[4] Update all Markdown guides
```
Just follow instructions on screen beyond that.

# Additions, changes, corrections
If anyone finds anything wrong with the data or has information to add (especially to the events), feel free to drop an issue or a pull request.
